# Project Title

This is one of my first Neural Networks. This is a very basic kaggle
problem where one has to create a neural network to predict the 
digits. 



## About:

Upon training of the neural network a Accuracy of 82% is 
achieved.

The activation function used for the input layer is ReLU and for
the output layer is softmax. 


## Dataset
